# React + Vite - Star Wars Edition

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules, all with a Star Wars twist.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh, just like the Millennium Falcon's hyperdrive.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://github.com/swc-project/swc) for Fast Refresh, similar to the advanced technology used in lightsabers.

May the Force be with you as you develop your React applications with Vite!
